# Simulation-based-on-the-spread-of-an-epidemic-in-the-city-of-P-au-P.
Commonly infectious diseases, epidemics which sometimes reach the stage of pandemic in relation to their spread from zone to zone, city to city, country to country and even from continent to continent have become a threat to the world population and above all, a point to be resolved immediately, let's take the example of covid19 which is shaking up the world, we use different prevention methods, for example by limiting unnecessary travel to avoid the spread, hence the term confinement. Therefore, it is necessary from our side as brief in the technological field to make an individual-centered simulation that can bring out the different spatial-temporal details that characterize the spread of the epidemic, so by this process we can have a global view of the situation while studying the possibilities that will allow us to prevent as well as control the spread of the epidemic during a pandemic. Therefore, we carried out this project in order to design and implement a simulation, using the GAMA 1.8 platform, a simple agent-based model to spatially and temporally simulate the spread of contagious diseases in a city.
